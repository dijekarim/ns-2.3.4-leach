USING LEACH: DISTRIBUTED CLUSTER FORMATION

Simulation will stop after 3600 seconds.
Base station at (50, 175)
Each node starting with 2 Joules of energy.

Energy Model:
		RXThresh = 6e-9
		CSThresh = 1e-9
		Rb = 1e6
		Excvr = 50e-9
		Efriss_amp = 9.6741659015025702e-12
		Etwo_ray_amp = 1.3037037037037037e-15
		Ebf = 5e-9
		Pidle = 0
		Psleep = 0

Thresholds chosen using original probs.
Desired number of clusters = 5
Spreading factor = 8
Changing clusters every 20 seconds
